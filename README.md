# StalkMeter
This repository contains the .R codes to process data obtained from the stalk meter used in the Oat Breedring Program at the University of Minnesota. 

Simulate_SMD.R simulates the type of data generated from the stalk meter; Stems_Energy.R attempts to organize the raw files, compiles in a file information regading energy stored in the measured stems, and plots energy and displacements interaction.


Please contact for any questions regarding the scripts.
